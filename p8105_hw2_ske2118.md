## ‘Problem 1’

Read and clean the data; retain line, station, name, station latitude /
longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA
compliance. Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a
logical variable (the ifelse or case_match function may be useful).

Import dataset and clean up column names

``` r
subway_df = read_csv("data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv")
```

    ## Rows: 1868 Columns: 32
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (22): Division, Line, Station Name, Route1, Route2, Route3, Route4, Rout...
    ## dbl  (8): Station Latitude, Station Longitude, Route8, Route9, Route10, Rout...
    ## lgl  (2): ADA, Free Crossover

``` r
subway_df = janitor::clean_names(subway_df)
```

Retain specified columns and convert entry variable from char to log

``` r
subway_df = 
  select(subway_df, line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) |>
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "NO", 0, 1))
```

This dataset contains variables about the NYC subway lines. Columns
include line, station name, coordinates, routes, entry, vending,
entrance_type, and ADA accessibility. It has 1868 rows and 19 columns.
To clean the data, I first used the janitor step to clean the column
names to use snake case formatting. Then I selecting our columns of
interst and changed the entry variable from character to logical. These
data are not fully tidy because the routes contain both doubles and
character variables.
