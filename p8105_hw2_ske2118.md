## ‘Problem 1’

Read and clean the data; retain line, station, name, station latitude /
longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA
compliance. Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a
logical variable (the ifelse or case_match function may be useful).

Import dataset and clean up column names. Retain specified columns and
convert entry variable from char to log. Convert route 8-11 to character
variables to match route 1-7.

``` r
subway_df = read_csv("data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1, route2,route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) |>
   mutate(
      route8 = as.character(route8),
      route9 = as.character(route9),
      route10 = as.character(route10),
      route11 = as.character(route11)) |>
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "NO", FALSE, TRUE)) 
```

Apply pivot_longer to tidy up route columns.

``` r
subway_df <- subway_df |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = route1:route11,
    names_to = "route", 
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "subway_line") |>
  drop_na(subway_line)
```

This dataset contains variables about the NYC subway lines. Columns
include line, station name, coordinates, route,subway_route, entry,
vending, entrance_type, and ADA accessibility. It has 4270 rows and 10
columns. To clean the data, I first used the janitor step to clean the
column names to use snake case formatting. Then I selected our columns
of interest and changed the entry variable from character to logical.
Then I converted all the routes to character variables so I could apply
pivot-longer to get route1-route11 in rows rather than columns.

How many distinct stations are there? Note that stations are identified
both by name and by line (e.g. 125th St 8th Avenue; 125st Broadway;
125st Lenox); the distinct function may be useful here.

``` r
subway_df$full_station_name <-
  paste(subway_df$line, subway_df$station_name)
```

There are 465 distinct station names.

How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
sum(subway_df$ada, na.rm=TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 1616

There are stations

What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance?

### Problem 2

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows
with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in
read_excel use reasonable variable names omit rows that do not include
dumpster-specific data round the number of sports balls to the nearest
integer and converts the result to an integer variable (using
as.integer)

``` r
mr_trash_wheel = read_excel("data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                            sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N653") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
   drop_na(dumpster) |>
  mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls))
    )
```

Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda.

``` r
prof_trash_wheel = read_excel("data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                            sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:M123") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
   drop_na(dumpster) 

gwynnda_trash_wheel = read_excel("data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                            sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", range = "A2:L266") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
   drop_na(dumpster) 
```

Combine this with the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset to produce a single tidy
dataset. To keep track of which Trash Wheel is which, you may need to
add an additional variable to both datasets before combining.

``` r
mr_trash_wheel <- mr_trash_wheel |>
  mutate(wheel = "trash_wheel" ,
          year = as.double(year))

prof_trash_wheel<- prof_trash_wheel |>
  mutate(wheel = "prof_trash_wheel", 
          year = as.double(year))

gwynnda_trash_wheel  <- gwynnda_trash_wheel |>
  mutate(wheel = "gwynnda_wheel",
          year = as.double(year))

trash_wheel_tidy <-
  bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel, prof_trash_wheel, gwynnda_trash_wheel)
```
